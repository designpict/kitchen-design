<p>According to the Society of Motion Pictures and Television Engineers or SMPTE your home theater layout should give each seat a view of the entire screen thats within a 30-degree field of view so youll need to do a bit of math to calculate the theater seating dimensions that will keep everyone comfortable. A square room may be what comes to mind when considering your options. Realistic expectations need to be set at the layout stage like planning screen sizes seating arrangements and even the height and distance apart of audio equipment. Begin by configuring your room size adding seating and selecting screen and speaker options to visualize your home theater or media room layout.
