<p>At Audio Advice we have designed award-winning high-end theaters in the hundreds of thousands of dollars but most of the custom theaters we build range from 10000 to 50000. With 3D CAD layout all seats have a clear view of the screen while speaker coverage analysis ensures consistent high frequency dispersion across the audience.
